In this seminar paper, we introduced the problem statement of rendering participating media. We formalized the problem in a way that is applicable to usual ray tracing methods utilized in rendering algorithms. We also looked at subtasks needed, namely distance sampling and transmittance estimation. Without going into more advanced techniques, our aim was to lay the foundations for further reading into the topic, and gave pointers to notable research papers.
